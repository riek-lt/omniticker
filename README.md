# Omniticker

The Omniticker is specifically designed for Riekelt's stream, but can be adjusted if you know how to change paths.

## Installation
```bash
node index.js
```

There is a oneliner build-instruction with pkg in the first line of `index.js`.
```bash
pkg index.js --output omniticker
```

## Features

Asks if it wants to read the output of my music player.
Asks for a custom message
Reads my chat. Whenever someone uses the "first chatter" thing (once a stream), puts their name in the omniticker

Non asked; Reads different text files from Streamlabs' Streamlabels
